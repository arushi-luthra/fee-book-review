      >Greg is worried about starting middle school, and documents his
      (mis)adventures in cartoon form for our enjoyment. Dealing with his brute
      of an older brother, Roderick, and his embarrassingly geeky best friend,
      Rowley, Greg is struggling with popularity, avoiding bullies, figuring out
      what to do with girls, and avoiding that nasty patch of cheese out on the
      playground. This book is a brilliant tour of the realities of the middle
      school wasteland! The slightly irreverent humor and hand-drawn comic style
      of story-telling make it an easy choice for many middle school boys, who
      seem to identify with the truthiness of Greg's story. This is the first
      book in a series, and most kids who picked up the first book were likely
      to read them all!</p1

      Those Who Wish Me Dead is many things–a suspenseful thriller, a chase
      movie, a man vs wild adventure, and a film that comes in at a tight 90
      minutes (hallelujah).But it’s probably most notable as the first
      non-children’s movie Angelina Jolie has released in six years. Just in
      case we forgot what a formidable screen presence she is, here she is to
      remind us as Hannah, a gritty veteran smokejumper in the vast woods of
      Montana.She has a recent past trauma haunting her days – a terrible
      tragedy in which she feels she failed at her job, leading to the loss of
      lives. Stationed alone in a lookout tower, the isolation is atonement.When
      she stumbles across a bloodied young boy, Connor (Finn Little), lost in
      the woods, it’s a chance at redemption, even if she doesn’t know it yet.

      Having laid his noose around the neck of Karac Tor, Kr’Nunos now begins to
      tighten the rope. A vast armada sails south, ravers press toward Midland,
      and an ancient enemy rises from the west, forcing Arthur’s beleaguered
      armies into a devastating multi-front war. From Portaferry to the critical
      naval blockade at Seabraith, the Outlanders and the children of the Vanír
      use every shred of their arcane power to bolster strategic defense points.
      Yet the Horned Lord has left nothing to chance. Soon it becomes clear that
      his ultimate goal is not merely to eliminate his foes, but to vanquish
      history itself—to purge not only the lineage of men, but the memory of
      Aion, and everything good. In such a desperate hour, faith will be sorely
      tested. Sacrifices must be made. On the brink of despair, does the Ravna’s
      Riddle hold one final hope? And even if it’s true, will there be anything
      left to save?
